📝 To-Do List (Command-Line Python App)
This is a simple command-line based To-Do List application built using Python. It allows users to view, add, and remove tasks, with all tasks saved in a local tasks.txt file for persistence.

🚀 Features
📄 View Tasks: Display all the current tasks from the tasks.txt file.

➕ Add Task: Add a new task which gets saved to the file.

❌ Remove Task: Delete a task by selecting its number from the list.

🔚 Exit Program: Exit the application safely.

🛠️ How It Works
The program runs in a loop showing a menu with 4 options:

View — Reads and prints all tasks from tasks.txt.

Add — Prompts the user to enter a new task and appends it to tasks.txt.

Remove — Lets the user remove a task by entering its list number.

Exit — Ends the program.
